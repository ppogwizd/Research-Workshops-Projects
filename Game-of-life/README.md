## Introduction

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules. This implementation uses Cython to speed up the computations, making it suitable for larger grids and more complex simulations.

## Features

- Fast implementation using Cython
- Visualization in Jupyter Notebook
- Several predefined initial configurations to start with

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Cython
