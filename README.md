## Introduction
The Research Workshops course at the Warsaw University of Technology is designed to provide students with practical experience in conducting scientific research and developing engineering solutions. Students work on various projects that span multiple disciplines and apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.

## Projects
Below is a list of projects currently included in this repository:

### 1. Projectile Motion Simulation
